## <a name="design-choices">Design Choices</a>

---

### Fonts
- I used [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) for the body and after some deliberation and feeedback from some friends that tested the website I decided to use [Roboto Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Mono) for all the headings and navbar items.


### Colours
- As this is a website about growing seeds I decided to use green and white as the colours. 
- I used Matereialize's "light-green" class for the navbar and footer. 
- For most of the buttons I used Materialize's "green" and "darken-3" classes as I felt it paired well with the green of the navbar and footer. 
- For the "Cancel" and "Reset" buttons I used Materializes "red" class as it is a common colour for those types of buttons and it will help the user understand what they are for.
- The colour of the words in the navbar, footer and buttons are white.
- The background of the website is also white.

### Icons
- The icons that I used in this project were provided by [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/). I decided to use icons as they offer a pleasant visual aide to the site, also users tend to know that icons usually work as buttons.

#### Changes to Wireframes
